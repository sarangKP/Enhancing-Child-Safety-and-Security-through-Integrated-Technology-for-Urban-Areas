# Enhancing-Child-Safety-and-Security-through-Integrated-Technology-for-Urban-Areas

A real-time child safety alert system designed to enhance surveillance capabilities and proactively identify potential child abduction scenarios. This system leverages machine learning and embedded systems to recognize unattended children, alert caregivers, and assist authorities in rapid response. Integrated with CCTV infrastructure, it utilizes advanced image processing and real-time data processing to enhance child safety and mitigate abduction risks.

ðŸš€ Features

1. Real-time Monitoring: Processes live video feeds from CCTV systems to monitor children in public spaces.
2. Image Recognition with CNNs: Uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to accurately identify and differentiate children from surrounding elements.
3. Haar-Cascade Classifiers: Implements Haar-Cascade classifiers for efficient object detection and tracking of children.
4. Automated Alerts: Notifies caregivers and authorities when a potential abduction risk is detected.
5. Data Management: Matches missing and found children through dataset management, sending alerts to guardians if a match is confirmed.
6. Embedded Systems Integration: Optimized for embedded environments for seamless deployment and real-time response.

ðŸ“‹ Requirements

1. Python 3.x
2. OpenCV
3. TensorFlow/Keras (for CNN models)
4. NumPy
5. Embedded system compatibility (Arduino UNO)
